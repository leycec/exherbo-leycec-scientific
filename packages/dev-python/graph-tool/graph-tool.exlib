SUMMARY="Python package for creating, manipulating, and studying complex networks"
DESCRIPTION="
graph-tool is an efficient Python module for manipulation and statistical
analysis of graphs (i.e., networks). With graph-tool you can do the following:

* Easily create directed or undirected graphs and manipulate them in an arbitrary
  fashion, using the convenience and expressiveness of the Python language!
* Associate arbitrary information to the vertices, edges or even the graph itself,
  by means of property maps.
* Filter vertices and/or edges \"on the fly\", such that they appear to have been
  removed from the graph, but can be easily recovered.
* Instantaneously reverse the edge direction of directed graphs, and easily
  transform directed graphs into undirected, and vice-versa.
* Save and load your graphs from files using the graphml and dot file formats,
  which provide interoperability with other software. You can also pickle your
  graphs at will!
* Conveniently draw your graphs, using a variety of algorithms and output
  formats (including to the screen). graph-tool works as a very comfortable
  interface to the excellent graphviz package.
* Collect all sorts of statistics: degree/property histogram, combined degree/
  property histogram, vertex-vertex correlations, assortativity, average vertex-
  vertex shortest distance, etc.
* Run several topological algorithms on your graphs, such as isomorphism,
  minimum spanning tree, connected components, dominator tree, etc.
* Generate random graphs, with arbitrary degree distribution and degree
  correlation.
* Calculate clustering coefficients, motif statistics, communities, centrality
  measures, etc.
* Ad-hoc compilation and execution of C++ code, for efficient implementation of
  throw-away code for specific projects.
