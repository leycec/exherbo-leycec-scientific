SUMMARY="Python package for parsing command-line arguments."
DESCRIPTION="
argparse is a Python package for parsing command-line arguments, inspired by but
significantly improving upon the optparse argument provided by the Python stdlib.
It handles positional, zero-or-more, and one-or-more arguments, supports sub-
commands, allows alternative option prefixes like + and /, produces more
informative usage messages, and provides a much simpler interface for defining
custom types and actions.
