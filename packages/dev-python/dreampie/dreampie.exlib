SUMMARY="Python shell designed to be reliable and fun"
DESCRIPTION="
DreamPie is a Python shell designed to be reliable and fun. It was designed from
the ground up to bring a nice interactive Python experience, featuring an
interactive shell window is divided into a history box, which lets you view
previous commands and their output, and a code box, where you write your code.
This allows you to edit any amount of code, just like in your favorite editor,
and execute it when it's ready. You can also copy code from anywhere, edit it
and run it instantly.
