as simple and natural as possible:

* Supports Python 2.6 and later (including Python 3). Version 1.0 also supported
  Python 2.4 and 2.5.
* Rich API - chances are that whatever you want to do there's a simple and
  elegant way of doing it.
* Bit level slicing, joining, searching, replacing and more.

  integers and floats of different endiannesses.
* Powerful binary packing and unpacking functions.
* Read from and interpret bitstrings as streams of binary data.
