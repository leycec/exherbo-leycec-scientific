SUMMARY="Python package for creating, manipulating, and studying complex networks"
DESCRIPTION="
NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of
complex networks. These networks are encoded as graphs, digraphs, multi-graphs,
and hyper-graphs having edges (i.e., connections, links, ties, arcs, bonds)
between nodes (i.e., vertices, sites, actors) with optional weights (i.e.,
fields, properties). The potential audience for NetworkX includes
mathematicians, physicists, biologists, computer scientists, and social
scientists.
